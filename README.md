**Author:** Aaron Johnson, Drexel University  
**License:** MIT (see LICENSE file)

This repository contains standalone Python scripts for analyzing the relationship between healthcare technology adoption (AI and robotics) and county-level health outcomes. Each script is designed for independent execution to test specific hypotheses and perform targeted data analyses.

## üìö Research Overview

This codebase supports doctoral dissertation research examining:
- AI and robotics adoption patterns in U.S. hospitals
- Causal effects of technology adoption on health outcomes (premature death, preventable hospitalizations)
- Geographic disparities in healthcare technology access
- Hospital system characteristics and technology adoption
- Spatial clustering and health equity implications

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL database with research data
- Anaconda or pip for package management

### Required Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables for database access:

```bash
export POSTGRES_HOST="your_host"
export POSTGRES_DB="your_database"
export POSTGRES_USER="your_username"
export POSTGRESQL_KEY="your_password"
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

Each script is standalone and can be run independently. Most scripts follow this pattern:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

### Example: Running Multiverse Analysis

```bash
python ML_Multithreaded_Multiverse_101925_v1.py \
  --outdir ./multiverse_output \
  --n-reps 150 \
  --n-jobs 8
```

### Example: Negative Controls Suite

```bash
python Negative_Controls_101825_v4.py
```

## üìä Data Requirements

Scripts expect access to PostgreSQL database views including:
- `vw_conceptual_model` - County-level health and technology data
- `vw_county_tech_summary` - Hospital technology adoption metrics
- County Health Rankings (CHR) data tables
- AHA (American Hospital Association) survey data

**Note:** Data access requires proper credentials and institutional data use agreements.

## üìù Output Files

Scripts generate various outputs in designated directories:
- **CSV files**: Regression results, summary statistics, predictions
- **PNG/PDF visualizations**: Maps, plots, forest plots, heatmaps
- **Log files**: Detailed execution logs for reproducibility
- **Parquet files**: Intermediate data snapshots

Common output directories:
- `logs/` - Execution logs
- `output/`, `output_advanced/` - Analysis results
- `plots/`, `figs/`, `figs_advanced/` - Visualizations
- `multiverse_output/` - Multiverse analysis results
- `negative_controls_output/` - Robustness test results

## üî¨ Methodological Notes

### Causal Inference Methods
- **OLS with clustered SEs**: State-level clustering to account for spatial correlation
- **IPTW (Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting)**: Propensity score weighting for causal effect estimation
- **AIPW (Augmented IPW)**: Doubly robust estimation combining propensity scores and outcome modeling
- **FDR correction**: Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple testing

### Machine Learning Approaches
- **Stability Selection**: L1-regularized logistic regression with bootstrap resampling
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for feature importance and predictions
- **State-blocked cross-validation**: Prevents data leakage across geographic units

### Spatial Methods
- **Local Moran's I**: LISA cluster identification (HH, LL, HL, LH)
- **Lorenz curves & Gini coefficients**: Inequality measurement
- **BallTree nearest neighbor**: Efficient geospatial distance calculations
